  <title>Agents</title>

  <para>Jabber servers can have <wordasword>agents</wordasword>
  (or <wordasword>services</wordasword>) to give the user extra functionality.
  An agent is simply a server module that the server loads for things like
  searching for users through the Jabber directory, or 
  <link linkend="msg-gc">group chats</link>.</para>

  <para>A <wordasword>transport</wordasword> is a subset of agents that
  seamlessly bridges users to foreign protocols. By registering with a
  transport agent, a user can communicate with users on other networks
  with little effort.</para>

  <sect1 id="agents-reg">
    <title>Registration</title>

    <para>In order to use most agents, they must be registered
    with. After <link linkend="login">logging in</link>
    to a server, the <interface>Agents Browser</interface>, available via 
    <guimenuitem>Browse Agents/IM Systems</guimenuitem>
    on the <guimenu>Services</guimenu>
    menu, lists agents on the current server. Other servers can be
    browsed by typing the address in the server text box and
    clicking the <guibutton>Browse</guibutton> button.</para>

    <para>To register with an agent, highlight the agent's name in
    the agent list and click 
    <guibutton>Register...</guibutton>. The 
    <interface>Agent Registration</interface>
    druid will load to allow the user to enter specific information
    that the agent requires.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Agent Reliability</title>

      <para>Since the various agents are not actually a part of
      Gabber, they may experience unexpected outages that are
      beyond Gabber's control. If messages such as "error
      attempting to register with agent" or "error attempting to
      search agent" appear, they mean something is wrong with the
      agent on the server. Contact the server administrator.</para>

  <sect1 id="agents-search">
    <title>Searching</title>

    <para>By selecting an agent and clicking on 
    <guibutton>Search...</guibutton>, <application>Gabber</application>
	will load the <interface>Add a User to Your Roster</interface>
    druid. From there, users on the agent's network can be searched
    and added to the roster.</para>
