# gabber1
Gabber was a Jabber instant messaging client for the Gnome desktop environment. This is an archive of version 1 from 2002, which is even older than the 2004 ("gabber") archive.

## Note
JKM: I haven't tried autogen, configure, make on this. This is a copy of the contents of CVS from http://gabber.sourceforge.net/ .

This project is from 2002 or so, predating Gabber 2, which is archived in the `gabber` project.
